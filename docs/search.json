    "section": "Hello Quarto! A Quarto Chat with NASA Openscapes, co-hosted with R-Ladies Santa Barbara",
    "text": "Hello Quarto! A Quarto Chat with NASA Openscapes, co-hosted with R-Ladies Santa Barbara\nOur 6th Openscapes Community Call co-hosted with R-Ladies Santa Barbara featured a “celebrity interview” with NASA Openscapes Mentors Amy Steiker, Catalina Oaida Taglialatela, Aaron Friesz, with J.J. Allaire, lead Quarto developer and CEO of RStudio. The conversation was led by Sam Csik of R-Ladies Santa Barbara.\nQuarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc that allows users to create dynamic documents, presentations, websites, and more. What is especially unique about Quarto is that it works seamlessly across multiple languages -- R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS -- allowing for easy collaboration among users from different backgrounds and areas of expertise. Conversation was centered around the experiences of NASA researchers from different Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) using Quarto to enable collaborative, data-intensive, open science in the cloud. The recording is on Openscapes YouTube.\nJulie Lowndes is the director of Openscapes, and co-lead of NASA Openscapes with Erin Robinson. Julie is a marine ecologist turned open data scientist because she was so empowered by the R community. Sam asked Julie to describe Quarto - that she had heard it described as “a document, a system, and a way of life”. Julie confirmed -- Quarto is a document in that you can write prose, code, and render outputs like figures and tables all in one place (and also present it in a beautiful way!). She loves that it has a very similar feel to RMarkdown, yet Quarto as a system extends all the RMarkdown functionality that many R users already know and love to additional languages . And finally, this powerful system can become what feels like a way of life because it informs the way she works and collaborates both with herself and others.\n\n“As an R user collaborating with other R users, Quarto refines my RMarkdown experience. As an R user collaborating with Python users, Quarto helps us really reimagine how we work together.” — Julie Lowndes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulie screenshared a rendered Quarto document alongside the .qmd (“quarto markdown”) file that generated it in RStudio. She pointed out how similar .qmd files look and feel to .rmd (“R markdown”) files, and that there isn’t a rush to make the switch from .rmd to .qmd if you don’t want to -- but the migration is smooth if you do!\nCatalina Oaida Taglialatela is an Applied Science System Engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and The Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO DAAC). Catalina is focused on increasing the number of researchers who use NASA data by helping identify and reduce barriers to science when data and services are in the cloud. She shared that Quarto has enabled her and her teams to curate and organize materials from GitHub repositories in a way that is easy (and oftentimes, less intimidating) for data end-users and/or collaborators to engage with. The NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook, a Quarto website built by the NASA Openscapes Mentors, showcases clear step-by-step How-Tos on searching for and using Earthdata, in-depth, targeted tutorials and workshops, and also lessons that are currently under development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatalina commented that sharing works-in-progress was a new concept and certainly one that took some getting used to, but she hopes that this increased transparency will facilitate learning among those who are looking to expand on the work that her NASA Openscapes cohort members are doing.\n\n“Before Openscapes and Quarto, I was hesitant to put unfinished tutorials or ‘how-to’ notes on a public platform, but I’ve really come to appreciate this new open way of collaborating and developing in a way that lets others learn and scale up our efforts. I see Quarto as a tool that enables us to open up and share our process and artifacts in a way that is friendly to the broader data user community.” — Catalina Oaida Taglialatela\n\nAmy Steiker is the Data Service Engineer at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and specializes in creating data education resources, tools, and data transformation services. If you already love making slides in xaringan, it’s time to check out Quarto presentations! In just a few short weeks, Amy and her team were able to build some really stunning slides using Quarto for her 2021 American Geophysical Union (AGU) talk (check out the slides and use their source code as inspiration for building your own!). She stressed that while it at first seemed daunting to tackle this in a short period of time, the Quarto infrastructure made it really quite simple to generate content from a Jupyter Notebook with Python, preview changes “on the fly” to get slide formatting just right, and finally publishing and presenting it. Amy’s slides were some of the first ever(!) created with Quarto, providing both a challenge and an exciting opportunity to come up with creative solutions. As early adopters, getting the chance to try things out and work alongside J.J. and the Quarto developer team made it possible to push the limits of what was possible, and in some cases, inform Quarto features.\nJ.J. Allaire is the lead developer of Quarto and CEO and co-founder of RStudio, where he is focused on supporting technical publishing, data science, and open science. When asked about his motivation for developing Quarto, J.J. spoke first about RMarkdown -- for 10 years now, RMarkdown has empowered people to publish, communicate, and work reproducibly. For folks who are familiar with the R programming language, it has been an indispensable tool. A large motivation for developing Quarto is the ability to extend the best features of RMarkdown (and more) to Python (and Julia & ObservableJS) users, like the NASA Openscapes Champions. J.J. also discussed how the RStudio Visual Editor (in the IDE) has been developed in concert with Quarto, making it easier to write text and prose - whether you are a seasoned markdown writer or not.\nAaron Friesz is the Science Coordination Lead at NASA’s Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC). Aaron provides user needs insights and technical support for archive and distribution, service development, and outreach activities, including developing tutorials, scripts, and presentations. He pointed out that there was an initial learning curve when getting their Quarto infrastructure and development workflow set up, but that it was an awesome opportunity for all NASA Openscapes Champions to learn together and begin collaborating. Now the team has a framework that is open and automatically published (thanks to GitHub Actions) as they continue to iterate. Aaron has seen how Quarto can empower developers from different backgrounds -- using this tool, it’s no longer “R vs. Python” but rather a seamless integration of the two to produce common (awesome) tools. Aaron screenshared what it looks like to use Quarto with Jupyter Notebooks in the NASA Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAaron screenshared the _quarto.yml file, created in JupyterLab, which underlies the rendered navigation bar found on the 2022 ECOSTRESS Cloud Workshop website. Aaron pointed out that content for each menu item can be created as markdown files (.md) or Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb), as shown here, or even include RMarkdown (.rmd) and/or Quarto markdown (.qmd) files (among others). This interoperability makes collaboration among different language users working on the same product relatively seamless.\n\nConclusion\nLearning new tools can be intimidating, but just as the NASA Openscapes Mentors demonstrated, it is always more fun with a group of supportive friends and colleagues. We were thrilled to be joined on this community call by an engaged and excited audience full of both new and seasoned Python and R programmers, all looking to explore Quarto together. Following the “celebrity interviews” (editor’s note: Sam is an outstanding interviewer!), panelists and participants moved into Zoom breakout rooms to close out the evening with some R-Ladies Santa Barbara-style networking -- question prompts ranged from icebreakers to casual discussion on what folks were interested in using Quarto for. If you’re looking to get started on your own journey but aren’t quite sure where to begin, be sure to check out the event recording! You’ll find a live demo of the RStudio Visual Editor, how to add automatically-generated citations to your Quarto document by just supplying the DOI, and more."

    "text": "III. Adding a blog to your personal Quarto website\n\nTL;DR: A couple of steps are required for setting up your blog, but generally speaking, you’ll need:\nAngle Right a folder (i.e. subdirectory) to hold all of your individual blog posts – I called my folder posts (though the name is up to you). I also (optionally) added a _metadata.yml file to this folder which includes some formatting and configuration options that will apply to all blog posts in this folder\nAngle Right a listing page, which lists all of your blog posts for viewers to browse and click through – this is a .qmd file that you’ll add to your website’s navbar by including it in _quarto.yml\nAngle Right blog posts! Your listing page will be blank until you actually add your first blog post\n\n\nLet’s create those together now.\n\nCreate a /posts folder: Open up your Quarto website project (I find it easiest to do this in RStudio) and make sure you’re in your root directory. Here, we’ll create a new subdirectory, called posts (you can call this whatever you want), where all of our blog posts will eventually live. To do so, you can either (a) click on the add folder button, , in the Files pane, or (b) in the RStudio Terminal, run mkdir posts.\nOptional: Add a _metadata.yml file to /posts: While not required, a _metadata.yml file can make your life easier if you want certain options to apply to all blog posts that you create. Create this one of two ways: (a) In the RStudio Terminal, run cd posts to move into that directory, then touch _metadata.yml to create the file, or (b) click into the posts/ folder in the Files pane, then click Blank File &gt; Text File &gt; type _metadata.yml &gt; click OK. Open your _metadata.yml in the Source pane to add options. I like these options2, but it’s entirely up to you what you want to include (if anything at all):\n\n\n\n\n_metadata.yml\n\n# options specified here will apply to all posts in this folder\n\n# prevents posts from re-rendering unless explicitly told to do so (for more, see https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze)\nfreeze: true\n\n# enable banner style title blocks (see https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/title-blocks.html)\ntitle-block-banner: true\n\n\n\nCreate a listing page: A listing page is a page with content that is automatically generated from a list of documents – in this case, that would be a list of blog posts – and looks something like this (or check out my blog’s listing page):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example listing page from the MEDS Community Blog showing multiple blog posts. While the MEDS website/blog is created using {distill}, you can expect something super similar. Quarto has multiple listing page layout options (default – which looks similar to the MEDS blog, grid, table) for you to explore\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a listing page, add a posts.qmd file to your root directory. First, click on the R Project icon, , in the Files pane to jump back to your project’s root directory. There are a bunch of ways to create a new .qmd file, but one easy way is to choose File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document…. Below, I give mine the title “My Blog” when prompted (this name appears at the top of your listing page), then saved it as posts.qmd (but you can choose whatever title and/or file name you’d like).\n\n\nConfigure your listing page: Specify how you’d like your listing page to be arranged by updating the YAML section of posts.qmd. There are a variety of options that you can specify. Below are just a few, but be sure to check out other options:\n\n\n\n\nposts.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: \"My Blog\"\nlisting: \n  contents: posts # all Quarto docs in the `posts` directory will be included on your listing page\n  type: grid # or `default` or `table`; each type has its own set of yaml options to include\n  sort: \"date desc\" # can also sort on more than one field\n  categories: true # allows you to sort posts by assigned categories \n---\n\n\n\nAdd your listing page to your website’s navbar: Update _quarto.yml with your new listing page to add it to your site’s navbar:\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\n# ~ parts of `_quarto.yml` omitted for brevity ~\n\nwebsite:\n  navbar:\n    title: myWebsiteTitle\n    right:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - about.qmd\n      - posts.qmd # add your posts.qmd file to your navbar!\n\n\n\nPreview or Render your website: Make sure your listing page shows up by previewing (I typically run quarto preview in the Terminal) or rendering (click the Render button in the Build tab in RStudio) your website. You should have something that looks like this (we haven’t created any posts yet, so it’ll be empty for now):"

Make sure that your spelling/capitalization/punctuation is consistent across blog posts should you apply the same categories to multiple posts.\nAdding the citation option automatically generates both a BibTeX citation and reference for your blog post, and adds them to the bottom of your post.\nInclude an image (or gif) to add as a preview image, which will appear on your listing page alongside your post. Your image should live inside your post’s subdirectory (e.g. mywebsite/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/preview-image.png).\nSet draft: true while you’re still working on your blog post to prevent it from showing up on your listing page, site map, or site search (it will still be available at a searchable URL).

    "text": "V. Some additional authoring features to explore\nBlog posts are just Quarto documents, meaning you can combine prose, code, and embedded outputs all in one place, just like you would in any other .qmd file (which makes your blog the perfect place to create data science/programming tutorials both for yourself and others Face Smile Wink). If you’re looking for additional ways to enhance your posts, read on below:\n\nAdding footnotes\nThere are multiple ways to include footnotes throughout your blog posts:\n\nUse the [^#] syntax to denote where you would like a note to be inserted. Write your note somewhere below following the [^#]: your note here syntax. For example:\n\n\nI am going to insert a footnote here[^1].\n\n[^1]: Here is the associated footnote, which will appear at the bottom of my document in a \"Footnotes\" section.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can write your notes inline to avoid having to use identifiers (e.g. [^#]). For example:\n\n\nI am going to insert an inline footnote here^[Here is my inline footnote].\n\n\nYou can also add footnotes that include multiple paragraphs. See the source code for this blog post and take a peek at footnote #2 for an example on how to do so (or check out the Quarto documentation).\n\nAll footnotes will appear in a “Footnotes” section that is automatically generated for you.\n\n\nCreating a bibliography and adding citations\nQuarto supports the use of bibliography files for citing works throughout your blog post. There are a number of ways to do this, but so far, I’ve found creating a BibLaTex database to be relatively straightforward. This database takes the form of a plain-text .bib file where we can store all of our bibliographic information. That information needs to be encoded in a particular way (more on that below). Follow these steps to cite works in your blog posts:\n\nFirst, create a .bib file in the folder containing your blog post (e.g. myWebsite/posts/2022-10-24-my-blog-post/references.bib) using the touch command in your RStudio Terminal or using the Blank File &gt; Text File button in the Files pane. I called mine references.bib, but the name is up to you.\nTo use your references.bib file, you’ll need to add the bibliography option to your blog post’s YAML:\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"blog post title\"\n# ~ additional YAML options omitted for brevity ~\nbibliography: references.bib\n---\n\n\nNext, we’ll want to add some references. These take a particular format that generally looks like this (the number/types of fields included may vary):\n\n\n\n\nreferences.bib\n\n@type{key,\n  author = {LastName, FirstName},\n  title = {Title of work},\n  date = {YYYY}\n  url = {https://url.com},\n  langid = {en}\n}\n\n\nwhere type can be manual, book, article, misc, etc. (all case-insensitive) and key is the citation identifier used for inserting in-text citations (we’ll get there soon).\n\nThere may be instances where you want to cite a resource that already has a BibTex citation available for you to copy over to your references.bib file (e.g. this blog post). For most resources, however, you’ll need to construct your own. You can do this manually, or with the help of a BibTeX reference generator (Googling will yield plenty of options, but zoterobib is a great place to start. Note that you may have to make some manual adjustments). Check out my references.bib file for this post as an example.\n\n\nNow that you have BibTex references in your .bib file, you can start adding in-text citations. These generally take the form [@key] (but read more about Quarto citation syntax here). When you add an in-text citation, Quarto will automatically add the reference to the bottom of your blog post under the “References” section.\n\n\nTo give one final concrete example, let’s say I want to cite my first (ever) blog post from last year. I can copy the BibTeX citation from the bottom of the post and paste it into my references.bib file:\n\n\n@online{csik2021,\n  author = {Samantha Csik},\n  title = {Why Create Presentation Slides about Blogging When You Can\n    Just Blog about It Instead?},\n  date = {2021-09-24},\n  url = {https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2021-09-21-distill-blogs/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\n\n\nI can now add an in-text citation using the [@csik2021] syntax here Arrow Right (Csik 2021). Once cited, it will appear in my References section at the bottom of this post.\n\nThat wasn’t so bad, right?? What if I told you there was an even easier way to add citations….Start by popping over to RStudio’s Visual editor, if you’re not already there (you should see buttons for working in either the Source or Visual editor in the top left corner of your source pane), and follow the steps below:\n\nPlace your cursor where you’d like to insert a citation, then from the Insert drop down menu, select Citation.\nA new window will pop open with a number of different options for inserting citations. If you’ve already created a references.bib file, it will appear under the My Sources and Bibliography sections. You can choose any of your existing references to insert an in-text citation from or choose another option, like inserting a citation based on a DOI (!!! I can’t tell you how awesome I think this is !!!). Once you add an in-text citation based on a DOI, the BibTeX reference will automatically be added to your references.bib file, as well as to your references list at the bottom of your post. If you don’t yet have a references.bib file, one will automatically be generated for you. LIKE SERIOUSLY?? SO FREAKIN COOL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, back to being chill…\n\n\nArticle layout\nQuarto also supports a number of different page layout options to further customize the appearance of your posts. Explore different ways to position elements on your page, including embedding outputs, captions, references in your page margin (one of my personal faves…despite the fact that I don’t have any here in this post)."

    "text": "Task: Port the Openscapes website from blogdown to Quarto\nTo start, what does port mean? While it may be obvious to some, I feel like this word is sort of jargon-y. I first learned of it when Quarto was thrust into the spotlight and the R community at large began “porting their websites from distill/blogdown/etc to Quarto”. I came to understand that (at least in this context) “port” means “to convert or migrate” a website from one framework to another (or in other words, rebuild a website using different tools).\nSo why the need to port the Openscapes website to Quarto? Julie originally built the site back in 2018 using blogdown and the Universal Theme for Hugo (you can still check out the GitHub repo) – and it was really beautiful!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the old Openscapes website’s landing page, built using blogdown.\n\nUnfortunately, upgrades to Hugo were beyond Julie’s scope to maintain which meant the site could no longer build locally (i.e. you couldn’t preview the site on a personal computer). This meant that the site needed to be redeployed in order to view any changes. Not only was this a rather slow process, but it also meant that there was no easy way to test out new additions/pages/features (or even check for typos) before sharing those updates with the rest of the online world. Additionally, the Openscapes team has used Quarto since its earliest days (read more about that in their quarto blog posts) – it seemed like a good time as any to begin using this same tool for building the Openscapes website as well."

Rebuilding the Openscapes website meant diving deeper into custom layouts, responsive web pages, and generally, a whole lot of stuff I had little to no familiarity with…which honestly really scared me (aren’t freelancers supposed to know how to do what they’re being hired to do??). With Julie’s reassurances that not knowing was okay, and that there was time and space to learn together (very on brand for the community she and her team foster through Openscapes ), I set off on my first freelancing adventure."

    "text": "General Porting Process: Easy stuff first, then lots and lots of learning and iterating!\nDespite the fact that I was leading the charge on most of the technical aspects of this project, porting the Openscapes website was truly a collaborative effort involving myself, Julie, and Stefanie Butland, one of the core Openscapes team members and someone I’ve gotten to know through attending past Openscapes events.\nSteps for porting the website generally looked like this:\n\nRecreate as much of the website as possible: I created a Quarto website that looked as close as possible to the original blogdown site – this meant getting the main website pages and blog content moved over without much fussing. The most challenging part was creating a custom landing page that both matched the aesthetics of the blogdown site and that looked good on smaller viewports/mobile devices – this ended up being the last thing I addressed before wrapping up the project. Ultimately, I was able to recreate a Quarto-based Openscapes website that looked nearly identical to the blogdown version – it was really cool to see how flexible Quarto allows you to be!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the new Openscapes website’s landing page, built using Quarto! We were able to recreate the landing page so that it looked pretty darn similar to the blogdown site.\n\n\nIncorporate events: Openscapes Events were historically announced through a separate Events blog, which we decided to incorporate fully into the Openscapes website on its own events listing.\nFeedback & updates: Stef and Julie did multiple deep dive reviews of the website and I made changes based off their suggestions/requests. Some of these were minor (e.g. “Can we add a bit more vertical space in underlined text”, “this hyperlinked text is broken”), while others required a bit more thought (e.g. “let’s rethink how we structure content on this page”, figuring out CSS to style particular page elements). They also had the chance to share the website with a focus group, which provided invaluable feedback on content organization, language, etc. (e.g. “remove unnecessary text from the landing page”, “replace the words instructional materials with curriculum”)\nMore feedback & updates: The hardest part and also the most fun part was the back-and-forth discussion on how to rethink, try out, and change the website. We fiddled a lot with content reorganization and CSS styling to better highlight different resources/elements. It was a super collaborative and iterative process to get things to where they are now!\nFigure out responsive web pages: I saved the most technically challenging part (at least for me) for last – learning how to create responsive web pages (where content adjusts size and positioning based on viewport size) involved a lot of trial and error.\nDeploy with Netlify & troubleshoot redirects: It took us a minute to understand how to get redirects to work. I won’t go into that here, but you can read about our solution on our redirects wiki."

    "section": "Reflecting on the stand-out moments",
    "text": "Reflecting on the stand-out moments\nBuilding this website has been a real journey (a 6-month long one)! While I can’t recount all the details here, I did want to reflect on a few things I’m most excited about:\n\nGreatest victory: responsive web pages\nA responsive web page is one with elements that automatically resize and reorganize based on the size and shape of the viewport and/or device it’s being viewed on. This responsiveness is critically important for ensuring a high quality user experience, no matter how a user is accessing the website.\nFor example, note how elements organized in columns (e.g. Engage/Empower/Amplify, the three stat boxes) when the browser viewport is at full width will stack vertically once the browser window is made narrower (elements will also be stacked vertically when viewed on a mobile device):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nas opposed to columns getting crunched when the browser window is made narrower:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI left figuring this out until the very end…mostly because I had no idea how to approach doing so. The Quarto documentation makes reference to Bootstrap’s CSS Grid and provides a simple, but clear example of creating columns in our Quarto doc. This helped me get started on a non-responsive 3-column layout, which looks like this:\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-4}\nleft-hand column content\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-4}\ncenter column content\n:::\n  \n::: {.g-col-4}\nright-hand column content\n:::  \n\n:::\n\nwhere {.g-col-4} defines the width of the column (Bootstrap’s grid system has a total of 12 columns across a page, so each of our 3 columns will be a width of 4).\nI got stuck for a long while after this point – the CSS Grid documentation makes it clear that this approach can be used to create responsive columns, but I found the provided example to be a bit confusing. After a lot of trial and error, and stumbling across this table that (sort of) makes reference to .g-col vs. .g-col-md classes from the CSS Grid documentation example, I eventually got myself some working responsive columns. While I still don’t fully understand it, this is my best attempt at explaining my working solution…here’s what it looks like:\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}\nleft-hand column content\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}\ncenter column content\n:::\n  \n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}\nright-hand column content\n:::  \n\n:::\n\n.g-col-12 represents the width of each column when the viewport is made smaller (e.g. either a narrow browser window or on a mobile device) – since the width of our browser is a total of 12 units, each column will take up the full width of the browser and be forced to stack vertically.\n.g-col-md-4 represents the width of each column when the viewport is made larger (e.g. a browser window that takes up a full laptop screen) – in this case, each column will only take up 4 units, or a third of the full width of the browser and can sit side-by-side one another.\nHere’s the above example in action:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, I used this approach for all pages that needed responsive columns (largely the landing page, but also the Our Team page and Resources page). If you end up finding this helpful in your own responsive web page journey – Yay!! If you have an alternative or improved solution, or if you understand these CSS grid classes more than I do, please do drop me a line – I’d love to hear all about it \n\n\nFavorite new thing(s) learned: mobile device previews and regex\nOkay, I couldn’t choose one, so here are my top two:\n\nPreviewing a web page for mobile device viewing: When building my own personal website, I always took the “let’s make changes, redeploy, then check it out on my phone to see how it looks” approach…which is never ideal. Huge shout out to my husband, Brendan Shanny, who showed me that you can preview a website as it would appear on a mobile device directly from Google Chrome. Right click on a web page &gt; choose Inspect &gt; click on the button with the laptop and phone icon in the top left corner of the Inspect pane to toggle between standard computer and mobile viewport sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView a web page as if on a mobile device by clicking on the laptop/phone button (circled in red) at the top of the Inspect pane.\n\n\nRegular expressions (regex) are really powerful: I’ve heard the terms “regular expressions” and “regex,” and I know they underlie some really powerful R packages (e.g. {stringr} for manipulating character strings), but I never really knew what they were or how to use them. Julie first introduced me to using regex during one late-night co-working session (she broke out her original copy of Practical Computing for Biologists, by Steven H. D. Haddock and Casey W. Dunn, which includes an excellent primer). Not more than a few days later, we realized we needed to reformat our redirects file, changing the way blog post URLs were represented from this:\n\n\n# Redirects from what the browser requests to what we serve\nblog/2021/03/10-nasa-announcement /blog/2021-03-10-nasa-announcement\nblog/2021/05/03-noaa-nwfsc-champions /blog/2021-05-03-noaa-nwfsc-champions\nblog/2022/02/17-esip-winter-2022 /blog/2022-02-17-esip-winter-2022\n\nto this:\n\n[[redirects]]\n  from = \"/blog/2021/03/10-nasa-announcement/\" \n  to = \"/blog/2021-03-10-nasa-announcement/\"\n  status = 301\n\n[[redirects]]\n  from = \"/blog/2021/05/03-noaa-nwfsc-champions/\" \n  to = \"/blog/2021-05-03-noaa-nwfsc-champions/\"\n  status = 301\n  \n[[redirects]]\n  from = \"/blog/2022/02/17-esip-winter-2022/\" \n  to = \"/blog/2022-02-17-esip-winter-2022/\"\n  status = 301\n\nUsing regular expressions (directly in RStudio!) to create patterns for matching, locating, and manipulating text allowed me to quickly reformat the 100+ redirects all at once. I documented my workflow in our redirects wiki.\n\n\nFavorite website feature: wikis\nMy favorite website feature is actually not a feature of the website itself (), but rather our GitHub Wiki for documenting conventions and workflows for current/future maintainers.\nWhile most of my notes initially ended up in GitHub Issues (e.g. page structure/styling conventions (issue #4), Using knitr::include_graphics() (issue #11)), wikis seemed to be a more organized solution for sharing these notes (and other important information) with those who will be maintaining and making changes to the website moving forward. Wiki articles range from creating and categorizing new blog posts to adding images to the website in a consistent way to an overview of styling the website using Sass & CSS.\nI’m honestly so jazzed about wikis at the moment and plan to start using them more to share project-specific information. Recently I created a wiki to provide setup instructions for workshop participants – in the past, I’ve linked a shared Google Doc in the repository’s README with similar setup information, which is effective, but harder to keep track of as a maintainer.\n\n\nMost valuable personal growth moment: overcoming imposter syndrome\nI’ve struggled with imposter syndrome throughout my professional career (as so many do!) – and it is hard to shake the feeling that I’m not qualified to be doing [fill in the blank with any one of the things that I get in my own head about]. This project was not one of those things. And I totally credit it to the supportive (and just generally fun) community that Julie and Stef create. It’s not easy to foster an honest no-such-thing-as-failing environment, but I really felt that way from the moment I got started (which says a lot, given that I’d be learning on the go for much of the project). I feel very lucky and honored that they trusted me with this work.\nThe Openscapes team certainly practices what they preach – you can read all about the Openscapes Approach for promoting psychological safety, kinder science, and a growth mindset, as well as explore the many other great resources developed by Openscapes.\n\nYou can check out the Openscapes website at https://openscapes.org/.

I even practiced creating a fake blog post on my own (and very much still under development) personal website in case anyone asked me to walk them through the steps (I can’t look like I don’t know what I’m doing now, right??).\nTen slides deep and then it struck me – I was creating a presentation on how to blog without ever actually creating my own blog post?? Dammit. Doesn’t quite feel right. So here we are. Baby’s first blog post ~about blog posts~. I’d say this first post is half meant to serve our MEDS students as they embark on their fall quarter (and will surely be asked to blog every now and again) and half meant to be the catalyst I so desperately needed to finally put a little bit of writing out there in the data science world.\nSo here we go! I’ll start by sharing examples of different blogs that I think demonstrate a few creative ways to format and publish data science content. Then I’ll review some of the cool things you can do with {distill} to customize your own beautiful posts."

I learn by repeating things (usually many times), so taking the time to type out code/YAML headers has been helpful, albeit not at all novel. See a list of referenced resources at the bottom of this post.\nIf you have not yet made a distill site, there are many great tutorials out there. For MEDS students, I recommend following along with these step-by-step instructions by Allison Horst before moving forward. For a very brief intro on customizing your distill site using CSS, check out these slides.\n\nNote: The following section was adapted from Hill (2020)\n\nNow that you have your distill site up and running, you can create your first blog post by running the distill::create_post() function in your console:\n\ncreate_post(title = \"My blog post\")\n\nIf this is the first time you are creating a blog post, {distill} will add a directory called _posts/, which will contain this plus all future blog posts. You will also need to create a listing page, which will list all of your posts. Do this by adding a blank .Rmd file to your root directory by running utils::file.edit(\"blog.Rmd\") in your console, then add a YAML header to your new file as follows:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Blog\"  # any name you want\nlisting: posts # do this exactly\n---\n\nFinally, link your new listing page to your website’s navbar by editing _site.yml.

    "text": "IV. Customizing your distill blog & posts\nA couple simple touches can go a long way in improving the look of your distill blog. Here are some of the steps I followed to customize my first blog post.\n\nNote: This section’s content was largely adapted from Allaire et al. (2018)\n\n\ni. Preview images\nPreview images are those fun little thumbnails that appear alongside blog posts on your listing page:\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd your image to the folder where your blog post .Rmd lives (e.g. _posts -&gt; YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post -&gt; my_preview_image.jpeg). Then, add the preview field to the YAML header of your blog post .Rmd file and set the value to the name of your preview image:\n\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\npreview: my_preview_image.jpeg  # your preview image\n---\n\n\n\nii. Categories\nYou can assign each post to one or more “categories,” making it easier for your readers to filter content. Do so by adding the categories field to the YAML header of your blog post .Rmd file, then list whichever self-defined categories you would like your post to be assigned to. For example, I assigned this blog post to two catetories: distill and R:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Why create slides about blogging when you can just blog about it instead?\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\ncategories:\n  - distill # list as many categories as you'd like \n  - R \n---\n\nTake a look at your listing page to see all your categories (and how many articles are assigned to each). Assigned categories will also appear as metadata at the top of each post.\n\n\niii. Table of contents\nTable of contents can be helpful for readers to navigate longer posts. Add the toc (and optionally, toc_float) field to your blog’s YAML header as shown below:\n\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    self_contained: false\n    toc: true              # add a table of contents\n    toc_float: true        # float it (positioned on the left-hand side, rather at the top)\n---\n\n\n\niv. Citations\nYou can add automatically-generated citations to the bottom of your posts, making it easier for readers to reference your work.\nI did this by first adding the base_url field to my _site.yml and set the value to the landing page URL of my distill site. For example:\n\n---\nname: \"samanthacsik.github.io\"\ntitle: \"Samantha Csik\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\nbase_url: samanthacsik.github.io # add your website's landing page url\n---\n\nI then specified the slug (the unique identifying part of a web address) in the YAML header of my blog post .Rmd file (a slug will be automatically generated if not provided):\n\n---\ntitle: \"Why create slides about blogging when you can just blog about it instead?\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\nslug: csik2021firstBlog\n---\n\nYour citations will now appear as metadata at the bottom of your post upon knitting.\n\n\nv. Bibliographies\nYou can use standard R Markdown bibliographies to cite works throughout your post and include a corresponding “References” list. You will first need to create a .bib file in the folder containing your blog post. You can do so by running the file.edit() function in your console. For example:\n\nfile.edit(\"_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post/bibliography.bib\")\n\nNext, add the bibliograhy field to the YAML header of your blog post .Rmd file and set the value to the name of your new .bib file:\n\n---\ntitle: \"my blog post\"\n# (additional metadata excluded for brevity)\nbibliography: bibliography.bib\n---\n\nNow, add citation information to your .bib file. This is super easy if you are citing a distill article that has citation information already included – just copy and paste! Note: there are different formats (e.g. CSL or BibTeX) for creating bibliography files. I chose to use BibTeX.\nFor example, Allaire et al. (2018) includes the following BibTeX citation at the end of their post, which I have copied into my .bib file:\n\n@misc{allaire2018distill,\n  author = {Allaire, JJ and Iannone, Rich and Presmanes Hill, Alison and Xie, Yihui},\n  title = {Distill for R Markdown},\n  url = {https://rstudio.github.io/distill},\n  year = {2018}\n}\n\nNote the format of this citation, where type can be manual, book, article, misc, etc. (all case-insensitive) and key is the citation reference used for inserting in-text citations.\n\n@type{key,\n  ...\n  }\n\nTo include an in-text citation for the above reference, type @allaire2018distill (or if you prefer your citation to be inside parentheses, [@allaire2018distill]). Adding the in-text citation will automatically add the full reference to your “References” list at the bottom of your post. To read more about including bibliographies and citations in your blog posts, see Xie (2021) and Xie, Dervieux, and Riederer (2021).\n\n\nvi. Appendices\nWhile citations and references will be automatically added as appendices to your blog post (if you followed along with the steps above), you can add additional content here by adding the .appendix class to any level 1 or level 2 header. For example, I added an additional “Corrections” statement to my appendix below by typing:\n## Corrections {.appendix}\nIf you see mistakes or want to suggest changes...\n \nI had a ton of fun playing around with some of these easy-to-implement features that the {distill} package provides for customizing blog posts. And I had even more fun checking out other data science blogs as I looked for inspiration. I hope they inspired you too! Happy blogging Beaming Face With Smiling Eyes"

There are lots of great tools for building websites using R (e.g. {distill}, {blogdown}) – this year, we’ll be using Quarto, an exciting, new, and versatile publishing tool that supports R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS. Want to get started on building your own website using Quarto?

    "text": "Art by An Bui\n\n\n\n materials  source code\n\n\nAbstract\nAs your data processing and analyses get longer and more complex, the chances that you’ll benefit from writing functions and/or for loops will also increase. However, whether you’re a new learner or seasoned programmer, it can sometimes feel overwhelming to know exactly where to start – especially when you have an end goal that builds additional complexity/flexibility into your functions and for loops. Taking an iterative approach to building out your code can help make this process clearer, less daunting, and more fun. In this workshop, we’ll use one case study to practice breaking down the function and for loop writing process into manageable, bite-sized steps.\n\n\nAudience\nThis workshop was originally developed for the Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program, administered by the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management in partnership with the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis."

The {shiny} package provides a framework that allows R users to build interactive web applications and dashboards, and has become a popular tool for sharing data analyses and data-derived outputs with broad audiences. In this two-part short course, students will learn the fundamentals of reactivity, how to customize an application user interface (UI), best practices and workflows for developing shiny apps, how to deploy their apps online via RStudio’s hosting service, shinyapps.io, and more.\nPresentation slides are available here and are meant to be a stand-alone resource for those who were unable to attend the workshop, but would like to follow along/self-learn. The workshop walks through building a number of shiny apps and dashboards – find complete versions of each in this GitHub repository.\n\n\nAudience\nThis workshop was originally developed for the Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) program, administered by the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management in partnership with the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis.

Each year, the dashboard will be updated with new demographic data based on applications and admissions, provided by UCSB’s Graduate Division, and post-grad career placement data from the Bren’s Career Services Team.\nIn January 2023, I took over as the primary dashboard maintainer. This involved refactoring the code base, processing new data, and updating the dashboard. Some additional refactoring is likely to happen during the next big update in order to further simplify the code base and improve readability for future maintainers.\nCheck back each year to learn more about our Bren students!"
