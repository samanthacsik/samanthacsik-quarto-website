<!-- # Motivation -->
<p>It doesn’t get much better than playing around with data that mean a lot to you. For me, that’s my Strava data (yes, I do recognize that that might sound a bit silly) – I’m fortunate enough to have near-immediate access to some of the greatest hiking trails around (yes, I also recognize that I’m totally biased), and spending my free time romping around our local mountains has been so important for my mental health. <em>So,</em> when I was ready to do my first real deep-dive into learning how to build Shiny apps and dashboards, I knew these were the data I needed to use.</p>
<!-- # What's on the dashboard? -->
<p>This is very much an ongoing work in-progress, but the first version included a “Gear Garage” for tracking mileage on my hiking boots and bike, an activity heat map of all recorded hikes, bike rides, and walks, visualizations for exploring activity distance and elevation gain, and an interactive table of the raw data.</p>
<p>There are many more visualizations and features I’d love to add (but have been severely lacking the time to do so). I also still manually retrieve new activities using the Strava API via the <a href="https://github.com/fawda123/rStrava"><code>{rStrava}</code> package</a>, but I hope to automate this in the next version. Stay tuned!</p>

  <title>Bren Student Data Explorer</title>

<p><br></p>
<!-- # What's the Bren Student Data Explorer? -->
<p>In an effort to increase transparency surrounding student demographics and post-graduation career placement statistics, the <a href="https://bren.ucsb.edu/">Bren School</a> hired R Shiny Developer Fellow, <a href="https://github.com/hdolinh/">Halina Do-Linh</a> – she designed and built v1.0 of the public-facing <a href="https://shinyapps.bren.ucsb.edu/student-data-explorer/">dashboard</a> for exploring these data in summer 2022.</p>
<!-- # My role -->
<p>I (along with a number of other Bren staff) oversaw the development of Bren Student Data Explorer v1.0 (though to be clear, Halina led the design and technical development of the dashboard – it’s really her product to brag about!). Each year, the dashboard will be updated with new demographic data based on applications and admissions, provided by <a href="https://www.graddiv.ucsb.edu/">UCSB’s Graduate Division</a>, and post-grad career placement data from the <a href="https://bren.ucsb.edu/career-services">Bren’s Career Services Team</a>.</p>
<p>The proverbial torch was passed to me for the next round of maintenance and updates in January 2023. This involved refactoring the code base, processing new data, and updating the dashboard. Some additional refactoring is likely to happen during the next big update in order to further simplify the code base and improve readability – I’ll be working with MEDS Program Coordinator, <a href="https://www.jamiecmontgomery.com/">Jamie Montgomery</a>, to continue this maintenance year-to-year.</p>

<p><br></p>
<!-- # Project overview -->
<p>My first freelancing adventure(!) was spent porting the <a href="https://openscapes.org/">Openscapes website</a> from <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"><code>{blogdown}</code></a> to <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> and redesigning aspects of the website’s layout, styling, and overall functionality. I worked closely with <a href="https://jules32.github.io/">Julie Lowndes</a> (founding director of Openscapes) and <a href="https://stefaniebutland.netlify.app/">Stefanie Butland</a> (core Openscapes team member) to bring their vision to life and it was <em>seriously</em> such a fun project. I wrote a <a href="../../posts/2023-08-01-openscapes-website/index.html">blog post</a> about my experience / some of the highlights. Check it out!</p>
