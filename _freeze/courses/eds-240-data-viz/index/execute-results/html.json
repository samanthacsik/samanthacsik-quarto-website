This course will focus on the basic principles for effective communication through data visualization and using technical tools and workflows for creating and sharing data visualizations with diverse audiences.\n\nBy the end of this course, learners should be able to:\n\n- Identify which types of visualizations are most appropriate for your data and your audience\n- Prepare (e.g. clean, explore, wrangle) data so that itâ€™s appropriately formatted for building data visualizations\n- Build effective, responsible, accessible, and aesthetically-pleasing, visualizations using the R programming language, and specifically {ggplot2} + ggplot2 extension packages\n- Write code from scratch and read and adapt code written by others\n- Apply a DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) lens to the process of designing data visualizations\n- Assess, critique, and provide constructive feedback on data visualizations\n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](horst-ggplot-masterpiece.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='A fuzzy monster in a beret and scarf, critiquing their own column graph on a canvas in front of them while other assistant monsters (also in berets) carry over boxes full of elements that can be used to customize a graph (like themes and geometric shapes).

I am re-envisioning and teaching it for the first time in Winter 2024. Materials are still very much under development (as of Dec 2023) and untested -- I'm looking forward to reflecting on what worked and what to improve on after I finish up teaching in March 2024.\n\n\n",
