Learners, collaborators, and future employers alike will look to your public online profiles to glean information about you and your work. As data scientists, this often means that theyâ€™ll head to one of two places: GitHub and / or your personal website. This course is designed to help you both lay the foundation for creating and maintaining these profiles in an organized, informative, and visually-appealing way. Over the next several weeks, you will:\n\n- build and deploy your personal website using popular data science tools and frameworks\n- create your first (of many!) data science blog posts\n- learn about how best to communicate your work to different audiences\n- understand where and how to document your projects and code\n- and more!\n\n<br>\n\n::: {.grid}\n\n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](quarto.png){fig-align='center' width=50%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](github.png){fig-align='center' width=95%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::::\n\n<br>\n\n# When is this taught?\n\nI'm super excited to offer this new course starting Fall 2024 (so if you've stumbled across this here now, you'll find some very-much-in-progress materials). I've taught components of this as separate non-credit-bearing workshops since 2022: \n\n- [Creating your personal website using Quarto](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/)\n- [Customizing Quarto websites](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-quarto-websites/#/title-slide) \n- [Adding a blog to your existing Quarto website](../../posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/index.qmd)\n\nThe full course will include these, with an additional focus on GitHub as a professional portfolio. \n",
