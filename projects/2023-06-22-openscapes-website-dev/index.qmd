# Project overview

My first freelancing adventure(!) was spent porting the [Openscapes website](https://openscapes.org/) from [`{blogdown}`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and redesigning aspects of the website's layout, styling, and overall functionality. I worked closely with [Julie Lowndes](https://jules32.github.io/) (founding director of Openscapes) and [Stefanie Butland](https://stefaniebutland.netlify.app/) (core Openscapes team member) to bring their vision to life and it was *seriously* such a fun project. I wrote a [blog post](../../posts/2023-08-01-openscapes-website/index.qmd) about my experience / some of the highlights. Check it out!
