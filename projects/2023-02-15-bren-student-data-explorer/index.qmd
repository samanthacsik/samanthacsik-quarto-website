In an effort to increase transparency surrounding student demographics and post-graduation career placement statistics, [The Bren School](https://bren.ucsb.edu/) hired R Shiny Developer Fellow, [Halina Do-Linh](https://github.com/hdolinh/) in summer 2022. Halina designed and built v1.0 of the public-facing [dashboard](https://shinyapps.bren.ucsb.edu/student-data-explorer/) for exploring these data. 

Since then, the proverbial torch was passed to me for continued maintenance and updates. I collaborate with the Bren Admissions and [Career Services](https://bren.ucsb.edu/career-services) Teams, as well as MEDS Program Coordinator, [Jamie Montgomery](https://www.jamiecmontgomery.com/), to update data, modify visuals, and refactor the code, as needed, each year.

Atop the image reads in all capital letters, 'BREN STUDENT DATA EXPLORER'. Beneath the banner image are two side-by-side boxes with text. The top of the left-hand box reads, 'Learn about students at the Bren School', and the top of the right-hand box reads, 'About the data'. A left-hand sidebar indicates that we're viewing the Welcome page. Two other pages are listed below: Demographics and Career Outcomes." width="70%">
